# Week 1 HTML, CSS, GIT Challenge: Code Refactor

Using the WHEN/THEN provided by Horiseon I have updated the site.  First going over the HTML elements, I updated some of the divâ€™s in the beginning to <header> elements, followed by the <footer> at the bottom.  I moved the hero image from the CSS file to the HTML so it could have an alt attribute.  Also added alt attributes to the three pictures in the section with the content class. The title of the page has been updated to Horiseon - Digital Marketing. Their was also the need to consolidate some of the classes in the CSS, those I have changed are together under a comment.
